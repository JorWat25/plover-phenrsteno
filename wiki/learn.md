# The layout

Theories like StenEd and Phoenix are largely phonetic. Many words can be stroked phonetically to produce the written counterpart, and this is one technique that helps stenographers to surpass real-time speeds. Phenrsteno borrows from that, but implements it in a way that consistently agrees with proper phonetic theory.

Linguists use the word **[phoneme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme)** to describe a language’s fundamental units of sound. For example, the words /sɪt/ (sit) and /bɪt/ (bit) each have three phonemes, but only two in common: /ɪ/ and /t/. They are distinguished strictly by their first phoneme. Other examples of English phonemes are /k/, /g/, /θ/, /ə/, /ɑː/, and /iː/. The symbols used to represent these phonemes are part of the [International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet).

The Phenrsteno layout is built to transcribe phonemes, so printed on the keys are the IPA symbols that represent those phonemes.

<!-- Replace this diagram with a simplified one for learners -->

Now you have to power to turn IPA transcriptions directly into words! When transcribing a word, you'll need to think about:

1. How the word is **pronounced**
2. The **phonemes** that make up that **pronunciation**
3. The strokes for its **phonemes**

Step (1) you already know. Then there are some resources to help you with step (2) if you get stuck.

- Look it up in [this chart on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_chart#Vowels)
- Look up your word on [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page) and see if it has an IPA transcription

For step (3) you should memorise the information in the diagrams and tables in this article.

# Chorded phonemes

This sections describes how you can transcribe phonemes other than those printed on the keys.

## Vowels

![phenrsteno layout](./wiki/png/layout-vowels.png)

Some secondary vowel sounds are shown in the diagram above. Diphthongs like \[aɪ\] and \[eɪ\] arise naturally from the layout, whereas strokes for the other vowel sounds are in the table below.

| Vowel  | Stroke |
| :----- | :----- |
| //ə//  | `-`    |
| //ɒ//  | `ae`   |
| //iː// | `ɪʊ`   |
| //uː// | `eʊ`   |
| //ɑː// | `aɪʊ`  |
| //ɔː// | `aeɪʊ` |
| //əʊ// | `aeʊ`  |

Note that for /ə/ you're not pressing any vowel keys at all.

## Consonants
